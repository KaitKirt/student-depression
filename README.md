# Student Depression Analysis 📊🧠

This project explores the relationship between **dietary habits**, **financial stress**, and **work/study hours** with self-reported **depression** levels among students. The analysis uses real-world data and employs visualization, statistical testing, and predictive modeling in **R**.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Understand patterns between student lifestyle factors and depression.
- Use visualizations and t-tests to examine significant group differences.
- Build a logistic regression model to predict depression based on key features.

## 📂 Files

- `student_depression_analysis.R`: Main analysis script.
- `student_depression_dataset.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.
- `.Rproj` and RStudio-related files (optional for reproduction).
- `README.md`: This file.

---

## 🔍 Methods

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, formatting categorical/numerical data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Boxplots, bar charts, and correlation plots.
- **Statistical Testing**: Welch Two Sample t-tests on Financial Stress and Work/Study Hours.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Logistic regression using `glm()` with depression as the binary outcome.

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- Financial stress and long work/study hours show strong associations with depression.
- Healthy dietary habits may have a protective effect but were less predictive.
- Logistic regression confirms these variables significantly contribute to depression predictions.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Language**: R
- **Libraries**: `ggplot2`, `stats`, base R
- **Environment**: RStudio

## 📎 How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `student_depression_analysis.R` in RStudio.
3. Make sure the CSV file is in your working directory.
4. Run the script from top to bottom.

## 🧠 Acknowledgements

This project was shaped by the guidance and experience I gained in my statistics classes, particularly through working on the LAPD project and a happiness study. Those earlier analyses helped build the skills and understanding necessary for this depression-focused exploration.
